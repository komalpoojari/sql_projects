Built a content-based movie recommender using Python and NLP techniques.
Processed movie metadata (genres, keywords, overview) with stemming and text vectorization
(CountVectorizer).
Used Cosine Similarity to suggest top 5 similar movies; implemented case-insensitive title matching for
better user experience.
Applied data cleaning and preprocessing ensuring improved recommendation accuracy and faster query
responses.
